                clean and professional website that looks great whether your
                customer finds you on their phone or laptop.

                  This website was a hands-on project I created to strengthen my
                  skills in responsive design and gain experience with SEO
                  optimization. I applied real-world SEO practices such as using
                  relevant keywords in the site’s content.

                  I designed and developed a fictional antique store website
                  using WordPress with the Astra theme. This was my project I
                  did to learn the inner workings of WordPress and WooCommerce.

                I begin by learning about your brand, goals, and target
                audience. Based on that, I create a website blueprint outlining
                the structure and design direction. You’ll have the opportunity
                to review and request revisions before development begins.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once approved, I move into the coding phase and provide regular
                progress updates to keep you informed every step of the way.
                Once done with coding, I will present you the finished product,
                allowing for 2 rounds of revisions.

                Final delivery includes deployment and basic performance
                optimization.

                I will work with you to learn more about your brand, goals, and
                target audience. If you want to purchase your own domain, I can
                guide you through purchasing your domain early on, so you have
                full ownership and control from the start.

              <p>
                Next, I create a website blueprint for your review and make any
                adjustments based on your feedback. During development, I
                provide regular updates so you always know what’s happening.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also help write the copy for your website so you don't have
                to.

              <p>

                I offer a flat rate of $300 for a complete website. This
                includes design, development, and up to 5 pages. After launch, I
                offer managed hosting and maintenance for $30/month, which
                covers backups, updates, and security. Domain registration is
                approximately $15/year and can be managed by me or handled
                yourself.
